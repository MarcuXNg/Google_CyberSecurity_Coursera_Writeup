## Security posture

An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change

# Security and risk management

- Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail.

# Assets security

- Securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

# Security Architecture and Engineering

- Optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

# Communication and Network Security

- Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

# IAM

- Identification: verify user by username, an access card, biometric data such as fingerprint
- Authenticatioin: verificatioin process to prove a person's identity such as entering a password or PIN
- Authorization: after identity verification, relate to the level of access depends on the role in the organization
- Accountability: monitoring and recording user actions such as login attempts to proved systems and data are used properly.

# Security Assessment and Testing

- Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- mitigate: giảm thiểu

# Security operations

- conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

# Software Development Security

- using secure coding practices

# Threats (mối đe doạ)

- A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. (hackers trying to steal data)

# Risks (rủi ro)

- A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset (likelihood that a threat will exploit a particular vulnerability and cause harm.)
- 3 level: Low, medium, high risk assets

# Vulnerability (lỗ hổng)

- A weakness that can be exploited by a threat (an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data. ) // cannot exploit themselves

# Ransomeware

- Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access. Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible.

## 3 layers of web

- Surface web
- Deep web
- Dark web

# RMF

- The steps in the Risk Management Framework (RMF) are prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor.
